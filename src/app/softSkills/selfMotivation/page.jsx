        <p className="text">Self-motivation is the foundation of my success in both my personal and professional life. I believe that motivation is not just a state of mind, but also an active process that helps me achieve my goals and dreams.</p>
        <p className="text">To stay motivated, I follow three key principles:</p>
        <ul className="list">
          <li className="item"><CheckBoxIcon fontSize="small"/><p className="text">Clearly defined goals. I always know what I want to achieve and why it is important to me. I write down my goals, break them down into smaller steps, and set deadlines for each one.</p></li>
          <li className="item"><CheckBoxIcon fontSize="small"/><p className="text">Continuous learning and improvement. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. This could include learning new skills, participating in training programs, or finding mentors and experts to learn from. I understand that stagnation can lead to a loss of motivation, so I always stay an active participant in my own learning and development.</p></li>
          <li className="item"><CheckBoxIcon fontSize="small"/><p className="text">Belief in myself and my abilities. I always remember that it is important to have a positive attitude and believe in my ability to achieve my goals. I strive to develop a positive mindset and support myself through challenges. I believe that a positive attitude helps me stay motivated.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text">In addition, I always try to stay inspired. I study the stories of other successful people, listen to motivational speeches, and read thought-provoking books. These sources inspire me and help me keep my motivation high.</p>
        <p className="text">In conclusion, my self-motivation skills allow me to stay focused on achieving my goals and developing as a person. I believe that self-motivation is a key component of success, and I always invest in its preservation and development.</p>
