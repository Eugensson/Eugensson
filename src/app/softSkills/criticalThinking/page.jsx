        <p className="text">Critical thinking is not just a skill, but a philosophy that guides my decisions in life and work. This ability is important to me because it helps me make informed and well-reasoned decisions, and avoid potential problems and risks.</p>
        <p className="text">The first aspect of my critical thinking is the ability to analyze information. When I encounter new information or a complex situation, I always carefully study it. I consider different aspects and sources of information to get a complete picture. This includes assessing the credibility of sources and verifying facts to ensure their accuracy.</p>
        <p className="text">The second aspect is my ability to identify hidden problems and risks. I always try to think critically and go beyond the obvious. I analyze the potential consequences of decisions and try to see the situation from different perspectives. This helps me avoid unexpected and negative consequences.</p>
        <p className="text">Critical thinking is not just about identifying problems, but also about finding solutions. I am constantly developing my skills in finding creative and unconventional approaches. I know that traditional methods can sometimes be limited, so I encourage myself to think innovatively and experiment with different approaches.</p>
        <p className="text">Thanks to critical thinking, I can be confident that my decisions are sound and well-grounded. This skill helps me not only in my personal development, but also in my work, where I need to make difficult and important decisions on a daily basis.</p>
