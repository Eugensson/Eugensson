        <p className="text">In my professional life, effective time management plays an important role in achieving my goals and success. I start my workday by creating a detailed task plan. This plan includes not only essential work tasks, but also time for breaks and short breaks for rest. I always estimate how long each task may take, and I add extra time for unforeseen circumstances.</p>
        <p className="text">In addition, I try to take into account my energy levels. For example, I know that I am most productive in the morning, so during this time I do the most important tasks. After lunch, my productivity may decrease, so during this time I focus on less important tasks or short breaks.</p>
        <p className="text">When I have to deal with changes in deadlines or priorities, I don&#x2019;t panic. Instead, I carefully assess the situation and make the necessary adjustments to my plan. I set new priorities and reallocate resources to ensure that important tasks are still completed on time.</p>
        <p className="text">This approach helps me not only to be more productive in my work, but also to reduce the risk of stress and overload. I believe that effective time management is an important component of success in any field of activity.</p>
